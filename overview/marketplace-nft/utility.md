# â–ª Utility

#### NFT's Beginning

A very common practice among NFT holders is to use the image attached to the non-fungible token in some of their own brands, either for commercial or personal use. The justification is that the NFT holder owns the image right to that work or design, and can do whatever he wants with it.

#### Integration of Metaverse with NFT's

NFTs may even have their trademark utility uncertain in the physical world, due to the lack of clarity-either on the part of the legislation, or the collection-about virtual property and right of uses. However, within the blockchain and Web3 ecosystem, this digital property is widely used along with smart contracts.

The same characteristic that can hinder the use of non-fungible tokens in the physical world (being a hash written in the blockchain and linked to a file), is what facilitates their interaction with smart contract networks.This interaction enables NFTs to be used as tickets on Web3. Once used as tickets, the wallet that owns an NFT can connect to more unique protocols such as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), metaverse land, classes, lectures, or investment clubs.

#### How does NFT staking work?&#x20;

NFT staking works the same way as cryptocurrency staking because NFTs are tokenized assets. Also, for NFTs, not all non-fungible tokens can be staked, just as this is not possible for all tokens. Since NFTs are tokenized assets, you can deploy them on NFT staking platforms where you can keep them safe. This is possible via a smart contract in the appropriate blockchain protocol.

To understand how NFT staking works, you need to know the ways of validating transactions on blockchain networks. The most famous methods are:

*   #### **Proof of Work (PoW)** <a href="#1-proof-of-work-pow" id="1-proof-of-work-pow"></a>

    This validation occurs by solving a mathematical problem with a computer.

    This process requires a lot of electrical power and computing power. So as an incentive for people to do these validations (also known as mining), the network rewards them with an amount of cryptos.
*   **Proof of Stake (PoS)**\
    ****In short, it allows users to use their coin balance as votes. The votes will be used to elect a number of delegates who manage the blockchain ensuring security and consensus.

    Finally, in Proof of Stake, transactions do not need to be mined. Thus, the computers only validate the transactions and are rewarded with a certain amount of cryptos. This amount is based on the volume of coins they already have.

    In other words, the more coins a computer has, the more transactions it can validate and the more coins it will earn. This is the process of staking. So, to be a validator on a blockchain network, you will need to own many of the coins that you intend to staking.

You can staking NFT using a wallet, a specific physical device, or by using the staking pool. The Trust Wallet and the Exodus Wallet are examples of wallets that already allow for staking.

#### Stake NFT's PokerVegas

We at PokerVegas will be using the method of staking by providers, in which we will offer dedicated services to users of NFT's stake. The return on this form of stake is characterized by the transaction fees of the $POKER token, where 1% of the purchase fee will be reverted to our stake.
