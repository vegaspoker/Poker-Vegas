# â–ª Utility

#### NFT's Beginning

A very common practice among NFT holders is to use the image attached to the non-fungible token in some of their own brands, either for commercial or personal use. The justification is that the NFT holder owns the image right to that work or design, and can do whatever he wants with it.

#### Integration of Metaverse with NFT's

NFTs may even have their trademark utility uncertain in the physical world, due to the lack of clarity-either on the part of the legislation, or the collection-about virtual property and right of uses. However, within the blockchain and Web3 ecosystem, this digital property is widely used along with smart contracts.

The same characteristic that can hinder the use of non-fungible tokens in the physical world (being a hash written in the blockchain and linked to a file), is what facilitates their interaction with smart contract networks.This interaction enables NFTs to be used as tickets on Web3. Once used as tickets, the wallet that owns an NFT can connect to more unique protocols such as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), metaverse land, classes, lectures, or investment clubs.

#### How does NFT staking work?&#x20;

NFT staking works the same way as cryptocurrency staking because NFTs are tokenized assets. Also, for NFTs, not all non-fungible tokens can be staked, just as this is not possible for all tokens. Since NFTs are tokenized assets, you can deploy them on NFT staking platforms where you can keep them safe. This is possible via a smart contract in the appropriate blockchain protocol.
