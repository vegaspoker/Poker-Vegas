# â–ª Where to buy ?

#### How and where to buy an NFT?

&#x20;For now, buying an NFT is not the simplest thing in the world. First, you need a digital cryptocurrency wallet.

MetaMask is the most widely used and allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.\
Once you have a balance in this wallet, you simply access a marketplace that specializes in buying and selling NFTs.\
The largest and most popular is OpenSea, an American platform created in 2017.There, you browse through various collections of NFTs, in categories such as art, collectibles, domain names, music, photography, and others.
