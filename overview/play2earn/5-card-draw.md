# ▪ 5- Card Draw

## 5- Card Draw

5-Card Draw is a game that many people grew up playing at the kitchen table. In this game your goal is to form the best five-card hand after an exchange. Like Hold'em, it is a game that is easy to learn but difficult to master.

#### Rules of 5-Card Draw&#x20;

Draw games are played with blinds and a button, just like flop games. Each player receives five cards from the hole hand. The first player after the big blind has the option to fold, check, or raise. The action continues clockwise around the poker table until the betting is complete for the round.Once the first round of betting is complete, a switch takes place. That is, each player chooses which cards (if any) to discard by clicking on them. By clicking a second time on the card you planned to discard, you remove it from the discard set. The discard continues clockwise around the table. When it's your turn to discard, you press the button to confirm that you want to discard the selected cards.

**After the first exchange, another round of betting takes place, starting with the first active player to the left of the button. Thus the sequence of action is:**

* Five cards are dealt to each player
* Bet Round #1, starting with the first active player to the left of the big blind
* Draw
* Betting Round #2, starting with the first active player to the left of the button
* Showdown (if necessary)

{% hint style="success" %}
In draw games, it is possible to need more cards than are left in the deck. In this case, the cards are reshuffled and the game continues using the new deck. For more information on reshuffling in draw games, see Reshuffling the Deck.

#### Showdown  <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

The player with the best five-card hand wins the pot. After the pot is awarded to the best hand, a new game of Five Card Draw is ready to be played.

If two or more hands are of equal value, the pot is equally divided between them. There is no differentiation of suits for the purpose of awarding the pot.
