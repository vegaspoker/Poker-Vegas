# ▪ Omaha Hi

### Omaha Poker - some history

The history of Omaha poker is shrouded in mystery. This legendary game has nothing to do with Omaha, Nebraska, save for its name. Omaha poker is a relatively new addition to the poker scene, debuting in Las Vegas, Nevada in 1982. Compared to other popular poker variants like Badugi poker and Razz, Omaha is a young gun. Before it became Omaha poker, the game was played in different forms in cities like Chicago and Detroit.

Back in the day, players were dealt 5 hole cards, not 4. Omaha was known as Twice Three since each player received 5 hole cards in a 52-card deck. You can imagine that the number of players was limited since so many cards were dealt to each player. As Omaha evolved, it became known by different names such as Oklahoma, Nine Cards, and Fort Worth. By this stage it was played with 4 hole cards and it became universally popular throughout the US. Since the game was known by so many names, a compromise was reached to name it Omaha, as that is pretty much dead center of the United States.

Now, Omaha has several names tacked on such as Omaha Hi-Lo, Omaha Hi/Lo, or 8 or Better. By 1982, Vegas casinos were showcasing this game in grand style. It is second only to Texas Hold’em as one of the legendary [poker games](https://us.888poker.com/games/). The game is especially exciting, as each player is dealt many more cards to form strong hands with. This means that it’s more common to make royal flushes, 4 of a kind, and other powerful hands. In case you’re wondering, the rules of play for Omaha and Texas Hold’em are similar. Two notable differences include the way you compile winning hands, and the number of hole cards you are dealt.

#### Rules for Playing Omaha&#x20;

Omaha poker rules are nearly identical to those of Texas Hold’em poker. The main differences come from the number of hole cards you are dealt – 4 instead of 2, and how you compile your winning hands. However, the are several other notable differences and we will get to them next.

In Omaha poker, each player receives 4 hole cards face down. Only that player can use his/her hole cards. Next, 5 community cards are dealt into the middle of the table for all players to use. In Omaha, you are required to use precisely 2 of your 4 hole cards and 3 of the 5 community cards to form your best hand. Omaha poker games are typically played in one of two formats: a limit format, or a pot limit format. Usually, players enjoy Omaha 8 or better, and Omaha hi.

#### Playing Omaha

With both no limit Omaha games and pot limit Omaha games, the sizes of the blinds routinely describe the types of games being played. For example, $2/$4 Omaha has a small blind of $2 and a big blind of $4. The betting starts with the player sitting to the left of the big blind (BB). If you are playing fixed limit Omaha poker, the small bet and big blind are identical, and the small blind is usually half the size of the big blind. Once the blinds have been posted, each player receives 4 down cards. The betting begins clockwise around the table, starting with the player to the left of the big blind.

#### The Pre Flop

During the pre-flop session, players take a look at their hole cards. They can choose to play by calling/raising the big blind. Players can also fold, raise, or call. The betting continues around the table with all players in the hand. Next comes the Flop. These are the first 3 community cards dealt into the center of the table for players to use. Play resumes with all active players left of the button. Once the betting round has completed, the next community card will be dealt. This is known as the Turn. This face-up card joins the first 3 cards in the middle of the table. Play continues with the first active player clockwise from the button. A betting round follows.

#### The River

The River is the fifth and final community card dealt into the middle of the table. A final round of betting commences with the first active player clockwise of the button. If more than one player remains after this round is over, the last betting player or the last player that raises will reveal his/her cards. If there was no bet in this round, the player clockwise of the button will reveal his/her cards first. The strongest 5-card hand takes the pot in Omaha poker games. If there are identical-value hands, the pot gets split 50/50 between players with the best poker hands.

### Hand Rankings

Omaha poker games are ranked according to the standard poker hand rankings. These include the following:

* **Royal Flush** - 10 through Ace with all five cards suited
* **A Straight Flush -** Any 5 consecutive cards of the same suit
* **4 of a Kind** - 4 cards of the same rank + another card
* **Full House -**  any two cards of the same rank + any three cards of the same rank
* **A Flush** - contains 5 cards of the same rank – no consecutive order
* **A Straight -** 5 cards in successive order of different suits.
* **2 Pairs Any -** card + a pair of cards of the same rank + another pair of cards of the same rank
* **3 of a Kind** - Any 2 cards + 3 cards of the same rank
* **2 Pairs** -  Any card + a pair of cards of the same rank + another pair of cards of the same rank
* **A Pair -**  Any 3 cards + any 2 cards of the same rank
* **A High Card -**  the highest-value card in your 5-card hand

#### Variation of the Game

Omaha poker is available in multiple variations. These include Fixed Limit Omaha, No Limit Omaha, and Pot Limit Omaha. Let’s briefly look at each of these variants:

#### Fixed Limit Omaha

has predetermined betting. During the pre-flop session and post-flop, all bets and raises are equal to the big blind. Once the fourth and fifth community cards are dealt, all bets and raises will double.

#### No Limit Omaha

games require that the minimum bet is equal to the big blind. Players can increase their bets as much as they want, provided they have the chips. The minimum raise must match the bet in the same round and the maximum raise is the value of your chip stack. Unlimited raises are possible in NL Omaha.

#### Pot Limit Omaha (PLO)

requires a minimum bet equal to the big blind. The minimum raise must match the previous bet or raise during the round. The maximum raise is the size of the pot. There is no limit on the number of raises permitted in pot limit Omaha.\
