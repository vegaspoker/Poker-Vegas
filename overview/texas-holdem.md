# ▪ Texas Hold'em

## Texas Hold’em <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

Driven by the popularity of televised poker, Texas Hold'em (aka 'Hold'em') has become the most popular poker game in the world, whether in casinos or online at PokerVegas. We'll go into more detail below, but here are the key points you need to know:

* Each player receives two cards, for his eyes only
* The dealer deals five cards - three at a time, then another, then another - that can be used by all players to make the best possible five-card hand
* Before and after each card is revealed, players take turns betting. To stay in the hand and see the next card, all players must have placed the same amount of chips in the pot as each other
* The best poker hand wins the pot

**It is a simple game to learn, but has the potential to be played with a seemingly endless variety of strategies, tactics, and nuances.**

## The rules of Texas Hold'em

Before you start playing Hold'em you need to learn the rules. In Hold'em, each player is dealt two cards of his own, called hole cards, which belong to him alone. Five community cards are dealt face-up to form the "board. All players in the game use these shared community cards together with their hole cards to form their best possible five-card poker hand. In Hold'em, a player can use any combination of seven cards available to make the best possible five-card poker hand, using none, one or two of his hole cards.

#### _The four major variations of Hold'em are differentiated from each other by their betting limits:_

* Limit Texas Hold'em: There is a predetermined bet limit on each betting round.
* No Limit Texas Hold'em: A player can bet any amount, up to his total chips.
* Pot Limit Texas Hold'em: A joiner can bet any amount, up to the size of the pot.
* Mixed Texas Hold'em: The game switches between rounds of Limit Texas Hold'em and No Limit Texas Hold'em.

#### Blinds

In Hold'em, a marker called the "button" or "dealer button" indicates which player is the designated dealer for the current hand. Before the hand begins, the player immediately to the left of the button posts the small blind, the first mandatory bet. The player immediately to the left of the small blind posts the big blind, which is usually twice the size of the small blind, but the blinds can vary depending on the stakes and the betting structure in play.

In Limit games, each big blind is the smallest bet, and the small blind is usually half the size of the big blind, but can be larger depending on amounts.

**For example:**&#x20;

* [x] In a $2/$4 Limit game, the small blind is $1 and the big blind is $2. In a $15/$30 Limit game, the small blind is $10 and the big blind is $15.
* [x] In Pot Limit and No Limit games, the games are denominated by the size of the blinds (for example, a $1 / $2 Hold'em game has a $1 small blind and a $2 big blind).
* [x] Depending on the structure of the game, each player may also have to put an "ante" (another type of forced bet, usually lower than the blinds, placed by all players at the table) into the pot.
* [x] Now each player receives his or her own cards. The action happens clockwise around the table, starting with the player 'under the gun' (immediately to the left of the big blind).

#### Player Bet Options

In Hold'em, as in many poker formats, the actions available are fold, check, bet, call or raise. The options available depend on the action taken by previous players. If no one has yet placed a bet, then a player may either check (pass without betting, but holding their cards) or bet (bet). If a player has bet, subsequent players can fold, call or raise. To call means to match the amount that the previous player has bet. To raise means not only to match the previous bet, but to increase it.
